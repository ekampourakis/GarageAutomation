# GarageAutomation

## This project is created to solve my forgetting the garage door open at night problem and leaving the lights on when exiting.

## The build features automated switching off of the lights after a certain amount of time and a wireless LED indicator of the garage door to install in your house.

## For more details the Instructables post will be posted soon.
